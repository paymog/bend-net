# bend-kit roadmap

The goal is a general-purpose library for Bend 2: the packages a program needs that Base does not have, each proved against its laws. This is a ranked backlog, not a promise. The top of **Next** is what we work on now. Each checkbox is one outcome. Re-rank items when evidence changes.

New packages are tracked as GitHub issues with a `pri-high`, `pri-med`, or `pri-low` label: high is what most programs need first, low is what can wait. `gh issue list --label pri-high` lists one priority. Each new package gets its own folder; see the layout in [README.md](README.md).

## Current baseline

- Packages on the Bend hub, published by hash and waiting for names: `bend-kit-http@0.14.0.0`, `bend-kit-bytes@0.3.0.0` (`0x49814d83de8f70993a43e1002be29ecd`; `http` still imports `0.2.0.0`), `bend-kit-wire@0.4.0.0`, `bend-kit-url@0.4.0.0`, `bend-kit-json@0.3.0.0`, `bend-kit-encoding@0.2.1.0`, `bend-kit-dns@0.3.1.0`, `bend-kit-zlib@0.1.0.0`, `bend-kit-router@0.1.1.0`. Each description links to its source folder. `http` and `dns` import their siblings by hash, so callers share their types.
- Laws: http 176, url 57, json 40, bytes 122, regex 54, unicode 35, zlib 22, dns 18, encoding 12, router 3. Run `scripts/check.sh` to check them all.
- Big bodies need a native build (`bend file.bend -o app`). The `bend file.bend` runner overflows on strings over about 30 KB.

### bytes

- `bytes@0.1.0` (`67341da`) is a byte buffer packed four bytes to a `U32` `Array` slot. It has bounds-checked `get`/`set`, `slice`, `append`, `concat`, `find`, and `eq`, and it converts to and from byte strings. `bytes/bench` measures the layout.
- `bytes` also reads and writes u16 and u32 in both byte orders (`get.u32be`, `set.u16le`, ...), searches with `find.from`, `rfind`, `starts_with`, `ends_with`, and `split`, orders buffers with `cmp`, and converts to and from hex and padded base64. `append` writes into the left buffer while it has room and at least doubles it when it does not, so building 200 K bytes one at a time takes 0.6 s instead of 215 s.

### wire

- `wire` holds the effects Base lacks: byte-exact TCP/UDP, a TCP connect with a deadline, and TLS through OpenSSL 3 loaded at run time (`BEND_LIBSSL` overrides the path). Each effect has a C and a JS version. The `.words` forms move bytes in the `bytes` layout, with no list cell per byte (`52ca321`).

### unicode

- `unicode` has Unicode 17.0.0 general category, canonical combining class, NFC and NFD, full case folding, and extended grapheme clusters, in pure Bend. `gen.py` generates the tables from the UCD. `conformance.py` passes every line of `NormalizationTest.txt` (NFC and NFD) and `GraphemeBreakTest.txt`. It is not published yet.

### regex

- `regex` compiles RE2 syntax to a Pike VM with capture groups and matches in linear time: `(a*)*b` against 200 000 a's takes 267 ms. Its fixtures agree with Go's `regexp`. It is not published yet.

### http

- `Http.fetch(method, url, headers, body)` does http and https, DNS, redirects (20 hops), and a 30 s timeout per step. It runs on a pool of its own that it closes; `Http.pool.*` keeps one idle socket per origin across calls and retries an idempotent request once when a reused socket fails before any response byte (`b566beb`). `fetch.with(..., ms)` sets the timeout. It returns `Result<Res, Err>`: bad URL, DNS, connect, TLS (errno and verify text), read, write, timeout, too many redirects, or a malformed response. `ETIMEDOUT` is 60 on macOS and 110 on Linux. Headers are a list per name. `header` is the first value. `Set-Cookie` is never joined. Encode writes one line per value.
- Bodies are `Http.Body` (`Bytes.Bytes` from `bend-kit-bytes`, with `Http.from_string`, `to_string`, and `length`): `Req.body`, `Res.body`, request bodies, stream pieces, and the wire bytes of `encode`, `encode_req`, and `exchange`. The `String` parsers (`parse`, `frame`) stay as the spec. `Http.text` decodes UTF-8. `Http.json` parses that text. `Url.form` writes a form body. `fetch` sends `accept-encoding: gzip, deflate` and decodes gzip and deflate through the `zlib` package (`4787d29`); an unknown coding is left as sent. `Http.open`/`stream.read` and `Http.upload` stream bodies in pieces (`ec55a76`).
- A bad chunk or bad framing is `FrameBad` while the connection is still open. A close-delimited TLS body that ends without `close_notify` is a read error. Content-Length and chunked bodies do not wait for that close. `100` and `103` are skipped; `101` is final.
- `fetch`, `exchange`, and streams read into `Bytes` and frame each read once: the head is parsed when it is whole, and chunk data runs are sliced whole. A Content-Length body of up to 16 MiB is allocated once from its length, and each read is written into it (#52). At 12 MiB a download takes about 7 ms in-process and peaks at 19 MB of RSS, down from 32 MB: the body sits in a 16 MiB array (arrays are a power of two in size). Chunked and close-delimited bodies still join their pieces at the end. Streaming the same body with `Http.open` peaks at 2.4 MB. It took 1.1 s and 1.1 GB with Content-Length, and 27.5 s chunked, which re-framed the whole buffer after every read (`http/bench/fetch16.bend`). A `String` body alone held 434 MB. The cap is 16 MiB of body and 64 KiB of head; before, a body of exactly 16 MiB failed.
- `Dns.resolve` checks `/etc/hosts`, then the first three nameservers. `resolve.at` asks one server. A silent server is 2 attempts × 5 s, then the next server. `Http.exchange` does one request on an open socket and says whether that socket can take another.
- `Http.serve` reads into `Bytes`, parses the head once, and joins the body once; chunk data runs are sliced whole. A 16 MiB upload takes about 0.03 s, down from 2.7 s on a `String` buffer and 0.26 s with a `String` body (`f3ceb23`, `http/bench/serve16.bend`). A 12 MiB response goes out in about 25 ms. It sends 100 Continue when a request expects it. It keeps HTTP/1.1 connections open and answers pipelined requests in order (`a7d28f7`). `serve.with` sets the request cap; the default is 16 MiB. A bad request is 400, an oversized one 413, a head over 64 KiB 431. It sends the RFC 9110 reason phrase, no body for HEAD, 1xx, 204 and 304, and accepts `HTTP/1.0` without `Host`.
- Header lines, request targets, and URLs parse in linear time. They were O(n²), so a 70 KB header or a 32 KB `Location` held a worker for 20 to 30 s (`05cbd5b`, `7487a84`). The `url` package has no `@unsafe` defs.
- The README install and fetch example pass on clean Debian 12 containers (arm64 and amd64), in the runner and as a native build. The x86_64 Mac is not tested.

## Next

- [ ] **Name the packages.** Every package is published by hash; the hub names at most five a day. The account's quota frees up around 2026-09-26 00:30 UTC: link `bytes`, `wire`, `url`, `json`, and `encoding` first, then `router`, `zlib`, `dns`, and `http` about a day later. The old `bend-net-*` names are frozen: they still resolve, but get no new versions. Run `bend link bend-kit-bytes@0.2.0.0 0xbf22530d1ea11c951d1ecaa353ed1580`, `bend link bend-kit-wire@0.4.0.0 0x8a1034c8824c5fdecbaa2e3d762aadad`, `bend link bend-kit-url@0.4.0.0 0xd248560355ba8929ae030bc9c72f40be`, `bend link bend-kit-json@0.3.0.0 0xaaa10a97bf5ac6990143da2c863f8a3f`, `bend link bend-kit-encoding@0.2.1.0 0xaec630f7a2f6b6ef96750f95d6e4195b`, `bend link bend-kit-router@0.1.1.0 0xf2239decc78af956c471ebf7f2f50374`, `bend link bend-kit-zlib@0.1.0.0 0xe01785b64266bf3ba0068183b9f9f5e3`, `bend link bend-kit-dns@0.3.1.0 0xa12defba527c5f86a84d6fb74968f8ef`, `bend link bend-kit-http@0.14.0.0 0x310b0480ce5b511ff8da9704b3d27ef3`. Then switch the hash imports in `http.bend`, `dns/dns.bend`, and the root tests, and the README table, to the names.
- [ ] **Prove universal laws.** Most laws are fixtures. Add laws over all inputs for the claims that matter most: `res.frame` agrees with `frame` for every split of the bytes, `dc.feed` of `a ++ b` equals feeding `a` then `b`, `parse.got` never says Bad to a prefix of a valid request, `utf8.decode(utf8.encode(s)) == s`, `Json.parse(Json.encode(v)) == Some{v}`, and `Bytes.to_string(Bytes.from_string(s)) == s` for every byte string.
- [ ] **Report the runner overflow upstream.** `String.repeat`/`String.length` on about 30 KB overflows in the `bend file.bend` runner but not in native builds. Report it to Bend with the three-line repro.

### Existing packages

- [ ] **Give `zlib` a `Bytes` input.** `decoded` turns a compressed body into a `String` for `zlib` and the result back into `Bytes`, so a large gzip body still costs a `String` of each size. A plain body is never converted.
- [ ] **Speed up JSON.** A 1 MB `Json.parse` takes about 3.4 s of CPU.
- [ ] **Stream in the server.** `serve` hands the handler a whole `Req` and sends a whole `Res`. Add a handler form that reads the request body and writes the response in pieces, on the same `Rb`/`ck` framing the client streams use.
- [ ] **Lingering close in `serve`.** After a 400, 413, or 431, `serve` closes with unread client bytes, so the client may get an RST instead of the response. Stop writing, drain for a moment, then close.
- [ ] **IPv6 and the rest of DNS.** Add AAAA records and IPv6 connect (the runtime's `io_sys_addr` is IPv4 only). Also add a TCP retry when TC is set, and a small TTL cache.

## Later

- [ ] **JSON number to F32.** `Json.at` and `Json.u32` exist. `json.encode` is still `@unsafe` because it walks a work list.
- [ ] brotli decoding, and gzip bodies with more than one member (only the first is decoded).
- [ ] u64 in `bytes`. Base has no `U64`; add `get.u64be` and the rest when it does, or return a hi/lo `U32` pair if a format needs it first.
- [ ] `Bytes` as map keys. Base's `Map` is a trie over `String` keys and takes no comparator, so `Bytes.cmp` cannot key it. Use `Bytes.to_string` as the key, or add an ordered map over `cmp`.
- [ ] More than one idle socket per origin in the pool, and decoding inside streams.
- [ ] A cookie jar, proxies (`HTTP_PROXY`), client certificates, ALPN, HTTP/2.
- [ ] Windows support (the effects use POSIX sockets and `dlopen`).
- [ ] Test on an x86_64 Mac.

## Depends on the Bend hub

- The hub registers at most five new names per account per day.
- Packages ship `.c` and `.js` effects that run host code, and proofs do not cover them. The hub does not show this before import.
